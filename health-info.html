            <h2>Understanding Heart Health</h2>
            <p>Heart health is essential to maintaining overall well-being. The heart is a powerful muscle responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Taking good care of your heart can prevent heart diseases like heart attack, stroke, and coronary artery disease. It is important to maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid stress to keep your heart healthy. <br>
            
                <b>A heart health report can include a cardiovascular health score, blood pressure, and other information about your heart health:</b> <br>
                <b>Cardiovascular health score</b> <br>
                The American Heart Association calculates a cardiovascular health score from 0 to 100 points based on eight health measures. A score below 50 indicates poor cardiovascular health, 50â€“79 is moderate, and 80 and above is high.  <br>
               <b> Blood pressure</b> <br>
                A healthy blood pressure is 120/80, and 140/90 is normal for most people. Higher blood pressure readings can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. 
               <b> Risk assessment</b> <br>
                A healthcare provider can use a risk calculator to estimate your risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from heart or blood vessel disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, cholesterol, age, sex, race, smoking, and medications.

                    <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/THT_Cardi-O_Stay_Hydr_V2.gif" alt="Healthy Diet GIF">
                    <p>Staying hydrated can help your heart by making it easier to pump blood throughout your body. Dehydration can cause your blood to thicken, which can increase the risk of heart attacks and blood clots <br>
                        <b>Heart function <br>
                            </b>
When you're hydrated, your heart can pump blood more efficiently through your blood vessels to your muscles. This helps your muscles work more effectively. <br>
<b>
Electrolyte balance <br>
</b>
Your heart relies on a balance of electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium to keep its rhythm steady. Without enough electrolytes, you may experience irregular heartbeats <br>
<b> Here are some tips to stay hydrated: </b> <br> 

Add some lemon or fruit to your water <br>
Set reminders to drink water regularly <br>
Limit your salt intake <br>
Avoid sugary drinks

                       <b> Regular exercise has many benefits for your heart, including: <br></b>
<b>Lowering risk factors <br></b>
Exercise can reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which is a major risk factor for heart disease. <br>
<b>Improving circulation <br></b>
Exercise strengthens your heart and improves circulation, which increases oxygen levels in your body. <br>
<b>Reducing inflammation <br></b>
Exercise can reduce C-reactive protein (CRP), a sign of inflammation and an increased risk of heart disease. <br>
<b>Reducing stress  <br></b>

Exercise can help reduce stress, which may contribute to other risk factors for heart disease.
